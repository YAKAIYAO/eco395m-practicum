Hi guys, this is Yakai Yao, I am second-year student in MAE. I am 
interested in data visualization and regression analysis. I have 
experience with Tableau to create different charts, graphs and maps. Also, 
I have experience with Python using Pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlibs to 
help people visualizing and analyzing data. I am eager to study things 
about ML and NLP. Also, I took Time Series and Casual Inference last 
spring semesters, hope it might help for our projects.
